      <h2 class="h2">1.	When did you start this blog?</h2><p style="text-align:justify;">I
      have kept an online journal (the “<a
      href="http://poorlawyer.tumblr.com">Blog</a>”) since I was
      thirteen.  The Blog has taken many different forms over the years.
       In high school, the Blog was hosted on LiveJournal and documented
      the tedious life of a quiet Vietnamese-American teenager living
      in Texas suburbia.  In college, the Blog moved to WordPress when I moved to New England; and the writing
      focused on homesickness and the strange world of an Ivy League
      school.  When I started law school, I moved everything to Tumblr,
      which is where the entries are currently <a
      href="http://poorlawyer.tumblr.com/archive">housed</a>.  This
      current domain (“<a href="http://www.poorlawyer.com">Poor
      Lawyer</a>”) originated in 2014, when I moved to New York City to
      start work at a law firm. </p>

    <div id="why" class="infoSection"> <h1
    class="visuallyhidden">Why</h1>

      <h2 class="h2">2. Why do you write?</h2><p style="text-align:justify;"> Writing has
      always been a passion of mine.  At an early age, I kept a journal
      in tattered composition books.  The Blog started off as a
      means to more scrupulously document the details of my everyday
      life.  To be fair, I still think that the Blog is a faithful chronicle
      of fairly mundane events and personal experiences.  I try to write every
      day. I’ve always been fascinated by history and memory — primarily how ossifying 
      memories through writing can preserve history.  A part of me feels that that which
      has failed to be documented will someday be forgotten, which makes me
      immeasurably sad.  So, that’s why I keep this huge repository of
      papered memories forever in stock: some memories, admittedly, more beautiful
      and glistening than others.</p>

    <div id="name" class="infoSection"> <h1
    class="visuallyhidden">Name</h1>

      <h2 class="h2">3.	What does ‘Poor Lawyer’ mean?</h2><p style="text-align:justify;"> The
      name is a <i>double entendre</i>.  On one hand, it describes
      ‘poor’ in a financial sense.  As a first-generation immigrant to
      the United States, I grew up with little means.  I was raised poor and have always
      identified with poverty.  In many ways, I work hard to
      pay respect to the struggles and sacrifices of my working class
      parents.  (Moreover, the juxtaposition between Millenials’ crippling student debt and the golden blessing of
      landing highly-compensated jobs was a fascinating paradox to me.) 
      Conversely, ‘Poor Lawyer’ is somewhat tongue-in-cheek: a sarcastic, albeit
      exasperated, plea—a conceit begging for sympathy and simultaneous
      understanding that the realities of the lives of others are not
      always as simplistic or winsome as they may appear. </p>
